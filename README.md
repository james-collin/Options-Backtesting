# Options Backtesting

## Purpose
This project is designed for backtesting options trading strategies by leveraging the Black-Scholes pricing model. Since acquiring historical options price data can be expensive, this approach utilizes underlying asset prices to compute theoretical option prices. By using the Black-Scholes model, we can estimate option premiums based on key market parameters, enabling a cost-effective way to test various trading strategies over historical data.

Backtesting allows traders and analysts to assess the performance of a strategy under past market conditions. This project aims to provide an efficient framework for evaluating different options trading approaches while maintaining accuracy in pricing and trade execution.

## Implementation Details
The core components of this project include the following modules:

### **1. Portfolio Module**
The portfolio module serves as the backbone of the backtesting framework. It maintains records of all trades, order placements, and account balances. The primary responsibilities of this module include:

- Tracking all open and closed positions.
- Managing cash balances and profit/loss (P&L) calculations.
- Storing trade execution details, including entry and exit prices.
- Supporting different trading strategies and order types.
- Ensuring accurate bookkeeping of margin and leverage, if applicable.

This module ensures that every transaction is logged correctly and provides valuable insights into the overall performance of the strategy being tested.

### **2. Black-Scholes Pricer**
This module is responsible for computing theoretical option prices based on the well-known Black-Scholes model. The pricing calculation requires several key inputs:

- **Strike Price**: The agreed-upon price at which the option can be exercised.
- **Spot Price**: The current price of the underlying asset.
- **Time to Expiration**: The number of days or time left before the option expires.
- **Risk-Free Rate**: A proxy for the interest rate used in discounting future cash flows.
- **Volatility**: The expected fluctuations in the underlying asset's price, typically derived from historical data or implied volatility calculations.

The Black-Scholes model assumes constant volatility and does not account for market microstructure effects or bid-ask spreads. However, it provides a useful approximation for theoretical option prices, making it a valuable tool in the absence of real market data.

### **3. Strategy Module**
This module defines the rules and logic for trading decisions. The strategy module plays a crucial role in determining when to enter and exit trades based on predefined conditions. Some of its key functions include:

- Establishing rules for opening new trades (e.g., based on technical indicators, moving averages, or fundamental factors).
- Implementing stop-loss and take-profit conditions to manage risk.
- Handling position sizing and capital allocation strategies.
- Closing existing positions based on predefined exit rules.
- Supporting multiple trading strategies, including single-leg and multi-leg options trading.

The strategy module enables users to backtest and refine different approaches before deploying them in real trading environments.

### **4. Data Feeds**
The data feed module is responsible for retrieving historical market data to power the backtesting engine. Currently, this project integrates data from the **Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)**, allowing access to:

- Historical underlying asset prices.
- Volatility indices and implied volatility data.
- Risk-free rate benchmarks for accurate discounting.

In the future, additional data sources may be integrated to enhance the accuracy of the backtesting environment, including alternative market data providers and real-time price feeds.

## Conclusion
This project provides a structured framework for options backtesting, combining portfolio tracking, theoretical pricing models, and strategy implementation. By utilizing historical market data and the Black-Scholes model, traders and analysts can simulate different trading strategies without relying on expensive options price data. The modular approach allows for flexibility and extensibility, making it easier to adapt the framework to evolving market conditions and new trading methodologies.

Future enhancements may include:
- Support for additional pricing models (e.g., Binomial Tree, Monte Carlo simulations, or Heston Model).
- Integration with alternative data sources to improve the robustness of backtests.
- Advanced risk management tools to assess portfolio drawdowns and tail risks.
- Implementation of live trading execution based on backtested strategies.

By leveraging this backtesting framework, traders can gain valuable insights into their trading strategies, refine their approaches, and improve overall trading performance before deploying capital in live markets.
